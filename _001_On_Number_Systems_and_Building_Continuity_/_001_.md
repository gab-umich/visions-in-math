# On Number Systems and Continuity

### _Since as young as I could remember, textbooks of mathematics I read started with an introduction of the appropriate **number systems** used in the rest of the book._

## Before This Chapter
There is no scope for the rest of this "book", or as it is now, no ultimate goal for this loose collection of free-thoughts on mathematics, nor do I have a targeted audience I am trying to sell my essays to. Yet I decided to follow the tradition subconsciously -- and for the following two reasons. 

1. Starting with **number systems** helps fostering a rigorous vibe in any encounter of numbers, so if you just decide to ditch my train after this one passage, there are still something you can take away. 

2. Number systems points out some questions that beg for an answer, and many of them are : 
    * "Why do we need number systems? (Why not just one big conglomeration that is the superset of everything?)" 
    * "What are mathematicians looking for when defining a _realm_ to work on?"
    * "How to understand the importance of a well-known number system?"

Furthermore, I would expect my reader to develop such _visions_ and apply them throughout any future chapters, even better, every time reading or working with math. All of the things I am going to write are revolved around one concept: _vision_, such visions are like a voice in your head constantly asking questions starting with _"Why"_ and _"How"_, and by the time you get used to them, they pin you directly to the most critical part of a theory. In my teaching experience I have encountered numerous cases of university students without a proper vision of math, asking these pupils to work in the field of engineering or science looked to me like sending a soldier without arms.
